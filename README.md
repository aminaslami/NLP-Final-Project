# NLP-MT5 Model - Final-Project

## Project Source: https://github.com/KrishnanJothi/MT5_Language_identification_NLP

## Running CUDA on Google Colab for free: https://medium.com/@zubair09/running-cuda-on-google-colab-d8992b12f767

That's important, in Google Colab please change the _Change Rum Time_ to _T4 GPU_ because some time you get error about Nivida and CUDA


If you get error on code please contact with me, (aminaslamiaf@gmail.com), I'm appericate to help.
